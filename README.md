# Wanderlei Color Scheme

A harmonious dark-themed color scheme for [Sublime Text 3](https://packagecontrol.io/). This scheme is based on the beautiful [predawn](https://github.com/jamiewilson/predawn) color scheme by [Jamie Wilson](http://jamiewilson.io/) with influences from Monokai.

Wanderlei is optimized for app and web development with an emphasis on Javascript (including ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) support), CSS/SCSS/LESS and HTML/Handlebars. I developed Wanderlei for personal use in Meteor and Javascript development, and named it after the legendary fighter of the same name.
